                    In the 2nd century AD,
                    ancient Greek astronomers synthesised t
                    he astronomical achievements of the time and
                    compiled 48 constellations. The stars within
                    the constellations were connected by lines,
                    imagined as animals or characters and given
                    names in conjunction with mythological stories,
                    which is how the constellations came to be.

                    Astrology believes that the celestial bodies,
                    especially the planets and constellations,
                    foretell changes in the world in some causal or
                    non-contingent way. Astrologers believe that the
                    movement of certain celestial bodies and their
                    combinations are specifically linked to the
                    occurrence and demise of the four elements of fire,
                    air, water and earth. The complexity of this c
                    onnection is a reflection of the ever-changing
                    nature of the human world.

                    There is an old Chinese legend that the goddess Weaving Girl and the mortal Cowherd fell in love. It
                    was not allowed for a man and a god to fall in love and the Queen Mother was so angry that she
                    pulled off her golden hairpin and cut a great river, the Milky Way, in the sky, separating them from
                    each other.
                    The Cowherd, who had lost his lover, cried every day. On the seventh day of the seventh month,
                    magpies used their bodies to build a bridge so that they could meet in the Milky Way. Later, they
                    became stars in the sky. You can see one bright star next to four smaller stars that look like
                    weaving shuttles: that is the star Weaving Girl (Alpha Lyrae). In the south-east of the Milky Way,
                    there is a bright star with a smaller star on each side: Cowherd (Alpha Cephei)
