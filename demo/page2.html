        Light pollution cuts off mankind's ancient connection to the stars 
    </div class="title2">
    <br>
    <div class="intro">
        The human eye can detect around 5,000 stars in the night sky. 
        But the light from skyscrapers, streetlights and houses obscures 
        all but a handful of the brightest stars. Light pollution is cutting 
        off our connection to one of nature's greatest wonders, harming 
        wildlife and hindering research that might help combat climate change. 
        Stars are more than just beautiful shimmering lights in the night sky. 
        They have shaped the mythology of every human civilisation. They guide 
        birds on their amazing migratory journeys. Now we need to do our part to prevent 
        light pollution so that the stars can be part of our future.

        What is light pollution
    </div class="text1-t">
    <br>
    <div class="text1">
        <dd>The term “light pollution” has been in use for a number of 
            years, but in most circumstances refers to the degradation of 
            human views of the night sky.</dd>
        <br>
        <br>
       <dd> We want to clarify that this is “astronomical light pollution”, 
        where stars and other celestial bodies are washed out by light 
        that is either directed or reflected upward. This is a 
        broad-scale phenomenon, with hundreds of thousands of light 
        sources cumulatively contributing to increased nighttime illumination 
        of the sky; the light reflected back from the sky is called “sky glow”. 
        We describe artificial light that alters the natural patterns of light and dark 
        in ecosystems as “ecological light pollution”.</dd>
        <br>
        <br>
        <dd>Verheijen(1985) proposed the term “photopollution” to mean 
            “artificial light having adverse effects on wildlife”. Because 
            photopollution literally means “light pollution” and because 
            light pollution is so widely understood today to describe the 
            degradation of the view of the night sky and the human experience 
            of the night, we believe that a more descriptive term is now 
            necessary. Ecological light pollution includes direct glare, 
            chronically increased illumination, and temporary, unexpected 
            fluctuations in lighting. Sources of ecological light pollution 
            include sky glow, lighted buildings and towers, streetlights, 
            fishing boats, security lights, lights on vehicles, flares on 
            offshore oil platforms, and even lights on undersea research 
            vessels, all of which can disrupt ecosystems to varying degrees. 
            The phenomenon therefore involves potential effects across a range 
            of spatial and temporal scales.</dd>

        <dd>However, there is no reason to despair. We create light pollution; 
            we can fix it.</dd>
        <br>
        <br>
        <dd>Around the world, the Dark Skies Association is working to educate 
            the public about the dangers of light pollution, lobbying for 
            legislation to protect dark sky reserves and encouraging people to 
            reconnect with the dark, starlit sky.The fight against light 
            pollution starts at home. If you need to keep exterior lights on 
            for safety, use shielded lights that glow downwards only. Use bulbs 
            that don't emit purple and blue light, as this is harmful to wildlife. 
            Smart lighting controls also help reduce the impact of your home on 
            wildlife and make it easier for you to observe the night sky.</dd>
        <br><br>
        <dd>You will also find interactive maps showing the level of sky pollution 
            in your area. These maps are created from data collected by satellites 
            and citizen scientists involved in the annual stellar count. You can 
            also help darken our skies. In the UK, the Annual Star Count 2023 will 
            take place from 17 to 24 February. And, no matter where you are, you 
            can take part in the year-long Global Night Star Count at any time. 
            The task is simple: go out on a clear night, count how many stars you 
            can see in a famous constellation (such as Orion) and report back.</dd>
        <br><br>
        <dd>To beat light pollution, we need to know how bad it is and what 
            impact national policies and local interventions (such as replacing 
            street lights in towns and cities) will have. In the UK, for example, 
            star counts suggest that light pollution could peak and start to 
            decline by 2020. Perhaps the most important aspect of star counts 
            is that they illuminate our disappearing night skies and inspire us 
            to take action. Ultimately, it is up to each of us to reduce our 
            impact on the sky by changing the way we light up our houses and 
            communities, and by lobbying our representatives to pass dark skies 
            legislation.</dd>
