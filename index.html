        Ecological light pollution
    </div class="title-2">
    <div class="intro">
        The term “light pollution” has been in use for a number of years, but in most circumstances refers to the degradation of human views of the night sky.

        We want to clarify that this is “astronomical light pollution”, where stars and other celestial bodies are washed out by light that is either directed or reflected upward. This is a broad-scale phenomenon, with hundreds of thousands of light sources cumulatively contributing to increased nighttime illumination of the sky; the light reflected back from the sky is called “sky glow”. We describe artificial light that alters the natural patterns of light and dark in ecosystems as “ecological light pollution”.

        Verheijen (1985) proposed the term “photopollution” to mean “artificial light having adverse effects on wildlife”. Because photopollution literally means “light pollution” and because light pollution is so widely understood today to describe the degradation of the view of the night sky and the human experience of the night, we believe that a more descriptive term is now necessary. Ecological light pollution includes direct glare, chronically increased illumination, and temporary, unexpected fluctuations in lighting. Sources of ecological light pollution include sky glow, lighted buildings and towers, streetlights, fishing boats, security lights, lights on vehicles, flares on offshore oil platforms, and even lights on undersea research vessels, all of which can disrupt ecosystems to varying degrees. The phenomenon therefore involves potential effects across a range of spatial and temporal scales.

        Ecological light pollution has demonstrable effects on the behavioral and population ecology of organisms in natural settings. As a whole, these effects derive from changes in orientation, disorientation, or misorientation, and attraction or repulsion from the altered light environment, which in turn may affect foraging, reproduction, migration, and communication.
